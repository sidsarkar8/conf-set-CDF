* **Unified Inference framework for functionals: Assumption-flexible with Post-Selection Guarantees**
  * Developing methods for deriving confidence intervals for various functionals (e.g., mean or median) under user-specified assumptions (e.g., finite variance or tail behavior), using confidence sets for CDFs.
  * This offers a flexible inference strategy that reduces dependence on strict assumptions and enhances applicability across diverse contexts.
